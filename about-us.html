        <h3>Who We Are</h3>
        <p>WeCary was founded in 2025 by a group of young enthusiastic students who wanted to make an accessible
          platform to connect all members of the Town of Cary and surrounding areas. We believe that keeping all
          residents engaged in some way or the other creates a healthy and active community. Our team ensures that
          everyone has a fair chance and can get involved with no discrimination.

        <h3>The Founders</h3>
        <p>We are a group of young enthusiastic high school students who are dedicated to serving the people of Cary and
          surrounding cities. We have experience with volunteering and have over 200 hours of community service. It is a
          pleasure to be able to bring together children, teens, adults, and seniors from all over Cary and work with
          them at every occasion, and will continue to do so.
        </p>

        <h3>What can you do?</h3>
        <p>Use our website to find local events and resources that may be helpful to you or anybody you know. The events
          page brings you with live and updated volunteering opportunities, activities, festivals, and much more. If you
          have your own event that you would like to add, you have the option to do so and contribute to the community
          as well! The resources tab lets you discover local services and how to access them. Whether it be
          participating in events, creating events, volunteering, donating, or finding resources, there is a way for you
          to interact with the community through WeCary.
